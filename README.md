# IMDB_watchlist_stats
Data analysis and visualization project based on my personal watchlist from IMDB during all the time

In this project, my IMDB watchlist was analyzed, consisting of all the films that I watched in my life (approximately)

The main criteria that were considered when identifying the final statistics:
- top numbers (total movies watched, most released decade, most popular director, most popular genre, most popular rating and duration intervals)
- grouping by decade of release
- grouping by project types
- grouping by rating intervals
- grouping by duration of the motion picture
- top 10 frequent directors (by number of films)
- top 10 genres (by number of films)


##### According to these criteria, diagrams were compiled and presented on 2 dashboards
